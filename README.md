# Phoneme-Based TTS Project

This project is built to train and evaluate a phoneme-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) model using paired audio and phoneme data.

---

## 📁 Code Files and Their Pipelines

### 1. `gruut_phonemizer.py`
- Phonemizes transcripts using `gruut`.
- Converts `.txt` or `.csv` metadata entries into phoneme sequences.
- Outputs `.txt` files with phoneme sequences per audio file.

### 2. `prepare_dataset.py`
- Loads metadata, audio, and phoneme files.
- Validates file existence and duration.
- Converts audio to tensors and stores phoneme sequences.
- Saves dataset as `dataset.pt` for training.

### 3. `train.py`
- Loads `dataset.pt`.
- Defines and trains a TTS model (e.g., NanoSpeech).
- Logs training losses, saves checkpoints and model weights.

### 4. `synthesize.py`
- Loads a trained model and phoneme input.
- Synthesizes speech from phoneme sequences.
- Saves generated audio as `.wav` files.

### 5. `evaluate.py`
- Evaluates generated speech using metrics like:
  - DTW (Dynamic Time Warping)
  - L1/L2 loss
  - KL Divergence
- Compares output with ground truth for validation.
